Docker is a powerful tool that helps developers deploy applications more easily. 
In short, Docker makes developing, testing, and deploying MERN stack applications smoother and 
more reliable!
Some key benefits of using Docker for a MERN stack application are :

1. Consistency: Docker ensures that our application runs the same way on every machine. 
                Whether we are developing on our laptop or deploying to a server.

2. Isolation: Each part of our MERN stack can run in its own container. This means that 
              the Node.js server, the MongoDB database, and the React app don’t interfere with 
              each other. If you need to update one part, it won’t break the others.

3. Easy Deployment: We can set up our entire application with a simple configuration file.
                    This file tells Docker how to start each part of our app which makes it 
                    super easy to deploy everything at once.

4. Better Development: Docker lets us to create a local environment. We can test our app just like
                      it would run live whihc helps to catch bugs early.

Real-World Example: Online Store
Imagine we are building an online store using MERN stack. Our application has different parts:
User Login: Handled by a Node.js service.
Product Listings: Managed by a separate MongoDB database.
Shopping Cart: Built with React.
By using Docker, we can run each of these parts in its own container. When we want to work on the 
product listings, we can do so without affecting the user login or shopping cart.
When it’s time to deploy, we just run a single command, and Docker sets everything up for us. 
If we need to update the shopping cart feature, we can do it quickly and easily which make sure 
everything works perfectly.
