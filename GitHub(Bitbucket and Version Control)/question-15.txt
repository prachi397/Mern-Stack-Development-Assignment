To resolve a merge conflict when merging a feature branch into the main branch:
step 1 : First,I will try to merge my feature branch into main using commands :
         git checkout main
         git merge feature-branch
         If a conflict occurs, Git will notify us of the files with conflicts.I will Open these
         files and manually resolve the conflicts by editing the code.
step 2 : After resolving the conflicts, stage the resolved files using 
         git add filename
step 3 : Complete the merge by committing the changes:
         git commit
step 4 : Push the merged code to the remote repository:
         git push origin main
