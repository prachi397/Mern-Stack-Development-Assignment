To set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application, 
use these steps:
step 1 : Create a GitHub repository for Node.js project.
step 2 : Add a GitHub Actions workflow by creating a .github/workflows directory in the root 
        of project. Inside this create a file like ci-cd.yml.
step 3 : In the YAML file define the workflow. It should run on specific branches 
         (like main or develop) when changes are pushed.
step 4 : The first job will be to build and test the Node.js application :
         --> Use the actions/checkout action to pull the latest code.
         --> Use actions/setup-node to set up a Node.js environment.
         --> Install dependencies with npm install.
         --> Run tests using npm test.
step 5 : After the tests pass add a deployment job that runs after the build:
        This could involve deploying to a cloud service or using an SSH command to deploy 
        to a server.
Once the .yml file is committed, GitHub Actions will automatically run the pipeline 
every time changes are pushed, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.
